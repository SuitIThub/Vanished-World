# Vanished World

An archived Unity-based 2D pixel RPG simulation project that aimed to create a living, breathing world with advanced NPC interactions and world simulation systems.

## Project Overview

Vanished World was an ambitious 2D pixel art RPG project that focused on creating a deeply interactive and simulated world. The game was designed with a top-down perspective and featured several innovative systems for NPC interaction and world simulation.

### Key Features

- **Fully Interactable World**: A rich environment where players can interact with various objects and elements
- **Advanced NPC System**: 
  - Text interpretation algorithms for natural NPC interactions
  - Simulated NPCs with individual memories
  - Dynamic daily schedules and routines
  - Complex decision-making systems
- **Pixel Art Graphics**: 2D top-down view with carefully crafted pixel art assets

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `Assets/Classes/`: Core game systems and classes
  - `Entity/`: NPC and character-related systems
  - `Management/`: Game management and control systems
  - `DataStorage/`: Data persistence and management
  - `Enum/`: Game-specific enumerations
- `Assets/Resources/`: Game assets and resources
- `Assets/Scenes/`: Unity scenes
- `Assets/Helper/`: Utility and helper functions
- `Assets/TextMesh Pro/`: Text rendering and UI components

## Technical Details

The project was developed using:
- Unity Game Engine
- C# programming language
- TextMesh Pro for advanced text rendering
- Custom behavioral systems for NPC decision-making and interaction
- Rule-based text interpretation for NPC dialogue
- State machine-based NPC scheduling and routine management

## Project Status

This project has been archived and is currently on hold. The repository contains the important assets and scripts from the development phase. While the project is not actively maintained, the codebase serves as a reference for the implemented systems and can be used as a foundation for future development.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Unity (compatible version)
3. Navigate through the `Assets` folder to explore the various systems
4. Check the `Scenes` directory for the main game scenes

## Note

This is an archived version of the project. While the core systems are preserved, some assets or dependencies might be missing. The project is shared for reference and educational purposes.

## Lessons Learned

While developing Vanished World, I deepened my skills in Unity architecture, state machines, and component-based design. I also learned to scope large projects better and iteratively refine systems based on testing.
